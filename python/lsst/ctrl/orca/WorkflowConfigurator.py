class WorkflowConfigurator(object):
    """Abstract class for configuring a workflow

    Parameters
    ----------
    runid : `str`
        run id
    prodConfig : `Config`
        production Config object
    wfConfig : `Config`
        workflow Config object

    Notes
    -----
    This class should not be used directly but rather must be subclassed,
    providing an implementation for at least _configureWorkflowLauncher.
    Usually, _configureSpecialized() should also be overridden to carry
    out the non-database setup, including deploying the workflow onto the
    remote platform.
